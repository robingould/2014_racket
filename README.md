# 2014_racket
some old racket code I found on old flash drives from 2014

Its genuinely crazy to me now that you can just put images inline in racket.

I was having such a rough time back then. I'm glad I could feel connected with myself from 9 years ago. 

4 Files I found. 
Fractal.rkt renders a Sierpi≈Ñski triangle

TempleRunGame.rkt is a clone of the dino game from google with a static camera. (looks insanely goofy, I probably drew the art in gimp) Also, I have no idea why I didn't align the ground with the game models. Oops)

The 3dportal.rkt file I think is starter code for a prototype of a game that I imagined similar to Splitgate 
The gamedatacollection.rkt file I think is a more flushed out version of that. I can't remember exactly. Found these in text documents in a google drive.
